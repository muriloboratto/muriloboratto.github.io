Hi. I am a Assistant Professor in the Department of Sciences at the University of Bahia, and Researcher at Supercomputing Center SENAI CIMATEC.

Research Interests
------
Our research is focused around High-Performance Computing, especially interested in Accelerating Computing and Parallel Computing. If you are interested in these areas and wish to collaborate with us, please get in touch with me.

More specifically, we are interested in GPU Programming that runs at the limits of the underlying hardware, where performance constraints dictate engineering/design decisions. Examples include, but not limited to:

 * Accelerating and Scaling GPU Applications on Multiple Nodes (e.g. CUDA, OpenACC, NSVHMEM, NCCL, CUDA-AWARE);

 * Tracing, Profiling and Benchmarking of Parallel Applications (e.g. Asynchronous Streaming, and Visual Profiling);
 
 * Portability e Optimization Parallel Code.

We look at these problems from the perspective of GPU invironments and their associated compilers, including topics like Auto-tuning. We work in diverse application areas including Geophysical exploration as well as Healthcare.
